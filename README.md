## Description
For our Visual Project, we were fascinated in building upon the idea of the neural style transfer, which basically leverages deep neural networks to change the appearance of a target image based on the appearance of a style image.

Not only did we find this technically interesting when exploring it in class, we also thought that it opened a vast array of creative possibilities.  As such, we began a process of exploring different tools and jupyter notebooks that implemented neural style transfers in order to gain inspiration as to what we wanted our project to be about. We knew from the get got that we wanted our project to be a tool anyone could use to create stylized images. After delving into different technologies and learning about them, we were able to conceive **Cartoonator**: a web-based tool that allows you to change your own target images based on your own style images. Users can upload target images and style images and see them being combined right there in their browser. In addition to adding ML-based styling, we alow users to draw on top of the image in order to spice up the generated artwork. We added this functioonality as we were interested in exploring authorship in AI-generated art. Are we the authors of the generated images as we were the ones who created this tool? Or are the authors the creators of the libraries we joined together to make this project a reality? Are the users of the tool the authors as well given how they can draw on top of the image after its been modified by our AI tool? How much do they need to draw oon the image to be authors? We dont know the answers to this questions, but we hope our tool creates discussions that one day can lead to solving them.
